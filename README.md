# Simplifying Graph Convolutional Networks (SGC) Re-implementation

## 3.1 Introduction [TODO]
- This repository contains a re-implementation of the Simplifying Graph Convolutional Networks (SGC) model proposed by Wu et al. The original paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07153).
- The paper shows that removing nonlinearities and collapsing weight matrices in Graph Convolutional Networks yields a simpler but effective model.
- Our project aims to [TODO].
